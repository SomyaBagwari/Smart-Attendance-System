Smart Attendance System

Overview

The Smart Attendance System is a machine learning-based project that automates attendance tracking using facial recognition. It eliminates manual attendance marking and ensures accuracy by detecting and identifying faces in real-time.

Features

✔ Face recognition-based attendance marking
✔ 96% accuracy using a clustering algorithm
✔ Stores attendance records in a database
✔ User-friendly interface for teachers/admins
✔ Secure and efficient attendance management

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, Pandas, scikit-learn

Database: MySQL/SQLite

Machine Learning: Deep Learning, Clustering Algorithm
